# P5--Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-R
Udacity Data Analyst NanoDegree

In this project we conduct exploratory data analysis and create an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, pattern, oddities
and underlying relationships of the White Wine dataset.

wineQualityWhites.csv - This tidy data set contains 4,898 white wines with 11 variables on quantifying the chemical properties of each wine. 
                        At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
                        
white_wine_ysis.rmd - The RMD file where we have conducted our EDA.
